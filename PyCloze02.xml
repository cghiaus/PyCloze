**Evaluation of convective exchange coefficients**

Let's consider a copper pipe in which a pump
circulates water. The tube is in still air. It is considered
that the temperature of the outer surface of the tube
is almost equal to the temperature inside the tube.


By using existing correlations for forced convection
in the tube and for natural convection in the air
(based on the Grashof number), find the values of the coefficients
of convective exchange in the tube (water - tube) and outside of the tube
(air - tube) for the water temperature in the pipe
$$\theta_{water}$$ = 330 K,
and the air temperature
$$\theta_{air}$$ = 250 K.

**Evaluation of convective exchange coefficients**

Let's consider a copper pipe in which a pump
circulates water. The tube is in still air. It is considered
that the temperature of the outer surface of the tube
is almost equal to the temperature inside the tube.


By using existing correlations for forced convection
in the tube and for natural convection in the air
(based on the Grashof number), find the values of the coefficients
of convective exchange in the tube (water - tube) and outside of the tube
(air - tube) for the water temperature in the pipe
$$\theta_{water}$$ = 340 K,
and the air temperature
$$\theta_{air}$$ = 250 K.

**Evaluation of convective exchange coefficients**

Let's consider a copper pipe in which a pump
circulates water. The tube is in still air. It is considered
that the temperature of the outer surface of the tube
is almost equal to the temperature inside the tube.


By using existing correlations for forced convection
in the tube and for natural convection in the air
(based on the Grashof number), find the values of the coefficients
of convective exchange in the tube (water - tube) and outside of the tube
(air - tube) for the water temperature in the pipe
$$\theta_{water}$$ = 350 K,
and the air temperature
$$\theta_{air}$$ = 300 K.

**Evaluation of convective exchange coefficients**

Let's consider a copper pipe in which a pump
circulates water. The tube is in still air. It is considered
that the temperature of the outer surface of the tube
is almost equal to the temperature inside the tube.


By using existing correlations for forced convection
in the tube and for natural convection in the air
(based on the Grashof number), find the values of the coefficients
of convective exchange in the tube (water - tube) and outside of the tube
(air - tube) for the water temperature in the pipe
$$\theta_{water}$$ = 360 K,
and the air temperature
$$\theta_{air}$$ = 300 K.
